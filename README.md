# PPISpan graph data mining algorithm implementation in C language.

This C module implements the pattern discovery algorithm PPISpan as referred in http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-276 . 
PPISpan searches for subgraph patterns in huge labelled graph and outputs all patterns that are statistically significant. It is tested on huge protein interaction networks and can also be used on others such as social networks or GIS networks. It can easily be modified to run on big data \ cloud clusters.
